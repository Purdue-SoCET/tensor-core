- Write data to wFIFO
    - ensure that gemm_complete and load_complete signals go high
    - ensure that correct data is stored in registers
- Write 4 types of data to rFIFO
    - ensure correct data is read
    - ensure that stores go to dramFIFO
    - ensure all other mats go to gemmFIFO
    - FIFO encodings are accurate for gemmFIFO and loadFIFO
