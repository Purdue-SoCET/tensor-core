This is "Atalla 0x01", a student-led initiative to design and implement a 
complete **AI Hardware-Software** stack -- from RTL to PyTorch integration. 

This project aims to become an open, reproducible, and 
research-grade infrastructure that unites all key accelerator 
components under one roof.

Current synthesis flows are built on MITLL90nm, but will soon 
be upgraded to TSMC65nm. 

The main source tree includes these subdirectories:
    /docs/ -> Documentation of Arch, Contribution Guide, etc. 
    /kernels/ -> Benchmarking kernels.
    /rtl/ -> Core Design Files. 
    /tb/ -> Formal, Functional and UVM verification. 
    /waves/ -> .do scripts for Questa.
    /scripts/ -> CI/CD pipelines
    /aihw-ppci-compiler/ -> Compiler Infra.
    /atalla-sim/ -> Cycle-Accurate Simulator.
    /UVM_1.2/ -> UVM 1.2 Core Libs.
    /LICENSE 
    /Makefile
