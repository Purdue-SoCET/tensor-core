# UVM---Tensor-Core

## Current Status
✅ Systolic Array functionality verified. <br>
✅ Tests can be driven constraint random and directed. <br>
✅ Tests were performed on Vivado, should work with QuestaSim as well. <br>
- Contains necessary DUT, include and test files in the [UVM](UVM/) folder
<br><br>
## To-do

- Check overflows, underflows, max-min range, weird inputs. 
- Feed undeterministic delays in inputs to observe behavior. 
- (Keep Adding to the list) - Use a test plan!
